Cycle 1: introduce subtle bass-reactive glow patterns along tentacle edges
Cycle 2: deepen concrete wear, add micro-fractures vibrating with low frequencies
Cycle 3: increase spatial scale perception, stars bending slightly around mass
Cycle 4: enhance subwoofer apertures, visible pressure waves in surrounding dust
Cycle 5: transition lighting toward colder deep-space tones with heavier contrast
Cycle 6: intensify motion inertia, slower but heavier rhythmic oscillations
