slow gravitational drift through space,
subtle rotational inertia of the woovercraft body,
tentacles oscillating rhythmically like speaker membranes,
bass-driven micro-vibrations rippling through the concrete shell,
pulsed light emissions synced to subwoofer resonance,
thrusters gently correcting trajectory with heavy inertia
