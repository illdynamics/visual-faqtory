MOTION INTENT (VIDEO FEEL):
- Slow cinematic dolly-in toward the central reactor (micro push-in).
- Gentle parallax: foreground tentacles shift slightly vs background screens.
- Reactive flicker: CRT scanlines roll, UI shards jitter, sparks burst in short pulses.
- Film-strip ring rotates slowly, frames scrolling like a conveyor.
- Volumetric smoke drifts sideways, embers float upward.
- Subtle camera shake on “impact moments” (very light).
- Glitch sweeps: occasional RGB split ripple and VHS tracking wobble (not constant, rhythmic).
