  "prompt": "A colossal post-human war entity rises from a shattered industrial megacity at the end of time. The environment is a post-apocalyptic techno-wasteland \u2014 collapsed refineries, skeletal cranes, broken factories, rusted pipelines leaking steam and fire. The ground is soaked in oil, ash, and rain \u2014 reflective, grimy, alive. CENTRAL SUBJECT A biomechanical cephalopod war-god, inspired by corrupted industrial sigils and the QonQrete iconography: Gigantic segmented metal tentacles, partially molten Hydraulic pistons snapping, cables twitching, gears grinding Reactor cores glowing molten orange + radioactive green Armor cracked open, energy bleeding through seams One massive cyclopean eye, scanning, judging, targeting The creature feels ancient and manufactured, like a forgotten AI deity reawakened. FOREGROUND A lone wonq warrior traveler \u2014 small, defiant, silhouetted against the chaos: Cloaked in tattered tech-fabric Cybernetic implants faintly glowing Standing still while the world burns BACKGROUND CHAOS Explosions ripping through steel megastructures Fireballs and shockwaves tearing metal apart Sparks raining like digital embers Collapsing cranes mid-fall, frozen in cinematic motion ATMOSPHERE Thick volumetric smoke, ash clouds, drifting embers Heat distortion, motion blur in debris God rays cutting through toxic fog Air feels heavy, electric, dangerous STYLE & AESTHETIC Glitch-industrial cyber apocalypse Brutalist sci-fi horror AAA game intro cinematic Unreal Engine realism Hyper-detailed concept art High contrast lighting Dramatic depth of field Sharp focus with chaotic motion cues COLOR PALETTE Burnt orange Toxic green Radioactive yellow Deep industrial blacks Oily metallic grays VIBE Brutal. Ominous. Mechanical. Awe-inspiring scale. A moment of silence before annihilation. The machine god has awakened \u2014 and it remembers everything.",
