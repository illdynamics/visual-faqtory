STYLE HINTS (STICKY RULES):
- Preserve the core identity: same control-room, same central machine, same two entities.
- Change only 10–20% per cycle. Small deltas > big resets.
- Keep the “glitch-industrial squidforge” aesthetic: grime, metal, sparks, CRT, VHS, RGB split.
- Prefer cinematic camera language: wide shots, parallax depth, shallow DOF, volumetric beams.
- Avoid: clean UI, minimalist sci-fi, cute stylization, watercolor, flat cartoons, overly smooth plastic renders.
- Prefer: brutalist cyberpunk, dieselpunk/steampunk elements, industrial horror, underground rave bunker.
