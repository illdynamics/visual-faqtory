title: Visual faQtory — WoNQ Squidforge Promo Run
mode: image
---

CORE IDEA:
A neon-industrial “QonQrete Squidforge” control-room where the Visual faQtory pipeline physically exists as a machine.
Two cyber-squid war-engineers operate it like a ritual: EVOLVE → MERGE → STITCH → FINALIZE.
Everything screams glitch, underground, brutalist sci-fi, hacker cathedral, post-apoc factory-rave energy.

SCENE / COMPOSITION:
Wide cinematic shot (2.39:1 vibe), central “reactor core” machine shaped like a rotating film-reel turbine.
A luminous ribbon/track spirals through the room like a conveyor of frames (mini-screens / hologram panels).
On left and right: two biomechanical cephalopod entities (QonQrete-inspired), pointing toward the machine like “this is the engine”.

SUBJECTS:
1) Left entity: hooded wonq-operator squid-cyborg with a skull-ish faceplate, one glowing lens-eye, one cracked lens,
   cables like dreadlocks, fingers like piston tools, dirty chrome + rust + oily grime.
2) Right entity: goggle-faced multi-lens squid-mech, heavy armor, reactor veins glowing toxic green + molten orange,
   hydraulic tentacles acting as robotic arms, pointing and “conducting” the evolution.

THE MACHINE (VISUAL FAQTORY AS A THING):
A massive industrial reactor with:
- rotating rings, gear teeth, brass/copper coils, green CRT glow, holographic UI shards,
- stitched film-strip band orbiting it, each frame showing abstract cosmic nebula + glitch fractals + squid silhouettes,
- sparks, welding arcs, lens flares, scanning lines, heat shimmer, volumetric fog.

ENVIRONMENT:
Cyberpunk factory bunker: brutalist walls, hazard stripes, server racks, cable bundles, warning LEDs,
graffiti runes, sticker-bombed panels, VHS static screens, surveillance cams, datastream rain,
particles floating like digital ash. Wet reflective floor with oil rainbow sheen.

AESTHETIC / RENDER:
Ultra-detailed, hyper-cinematic concept art, high contrast, dramatic rim light,
Unreal/AAA intro cinematic vibe, sharp micro-texture (scratches, grime, fingerprints),
glitch artifacts, chromatic aberration, CRT scanlines, subtle VHS noise, RGB split,
deep DOF with crisp focal subjects.

COLOR PALETTE:
Burnt orange / molten gold highlights
toxic green / cyber-lime emissives
electric cyan accents
deep blacks, oily metallic grays

BRAND PRESERVATION:
Keep the “Visual faQtory machine room” identity stable across cycles.
No cute/cartoon. No clean minimalism. Always underground industrial. Always wonky-tech.

EVOLUTION NOTE:
Each next cycle should mutate 10–20% only:
new hologram frames, new micro-graffiti, slight palette shift, tentacle pose shifts,
more/less sparks, different glitch intensity — but same core scene + same machine + same two entities.
